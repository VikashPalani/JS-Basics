/*In JavaScript, the event loop is a fundamental mechanism that enables the asynchronous execution of code.
Itâ€™s an essential part of the JavaScript runtime environment, allowing the language to handle non-blocking operations efficiently.

The event loop is responsible for managing the execution of code, handling events, and maintaining the flow of control.*/
